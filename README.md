Two Pic 
====
A new way to pick favorites.  This website uses anonymous accounts to submit pictures to our server.  From there, others will vote on two random pictures from our database to determine which one they like better.

## Todo: (Not necessarily in this order)
* Utilize a database to track posts and anonymous users
* Write Unit tests
* Hook up the database to track the different metrics off of our different pictures
* Add a captcha system and other anti-spam measurements
* Redo the entire front-end
* Build an admin system to approve submitted pictures
* Email users upon a picture submission 
* Security (our end and the users end)
* Deploy to a cloud hosting service
